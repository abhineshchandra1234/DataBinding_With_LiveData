## DataBinding
- As the name suggests, the data binding library allows us to bind UI components of the layout with data sources declaratively rather than programmatically.
---

## One-Way DataBinding
- In one-way data binding, only the data source can update the views on data change, views cannot update the data source.
- android:text=‚Äù@{employee.name}‚Äù

---

## Two-Way DataBinding
- Both the view and data source are in sync. Every change in view will be reflected on the data source and vice versa.
- android:text=‚Äù@={mainViewModel.nameLiveData}‚Äù
